# group-contact
This tool lets you create a single contact for one-time events which contains all of the participant's numbers.

Say, you organize a day trip with some people you don't know. You'd like to be able to call them directly from your phone, but you don't want to litter your address book with contacts you're probably never going to use again. Now you can.
